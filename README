WHAT IT DOES:
* dynamic loading of local javascript files, or js from any server
* dynamic loading of google's jsapi with your google api key
* the basics: loading google javascript api's through jsapi
* has no external dependencies
* provides a re.ready event for when all js files have loaded and jQuery is ready (please feel free to mod this for non-jQuery peoples)
* is free to use in many many ways via the MIT License

This is new, and only Chrome tested so far so feel free to fix it up and i'll merge githubs with patches.

BUT WHO IS APIs:
re.authorize(string key) -> loads the google jsapi with the given google api 
 			key
re.ready(function f) -> on load callback to f
re.load(String moduleName, String moduleVersion, Map optionalSettings)
	-> see google.load, a null moduleVersion and optionSettings specifies a url 
	   to dynamic load.

FURTHERMORE: 
 If you have problems make an issue.
 If you have solutions make a fork.
 If it's good let me know.
 If it's a job give me cash.
